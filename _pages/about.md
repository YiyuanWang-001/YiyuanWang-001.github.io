My name is Yiyuan Wang, and I currently reside in ZhuHai GuangDong. Now I am a Phd Student supervised by [Pro.Wentao Cheng](https://wtchengcv.github.io/) in HKBU-ZhuHai. And my research interests focus on **3D Computer Vision**, **Vision-Language Foundation Model**, and **Generative AI**.<br>
I once interned at the BeiJing DMS Lab, where I studied contrastive learning and multi-view learning under the guidance of [Prof. Gengyu Lyu](https://gengyulyu.github.io/homepage/)and [Dr.Yuena Lin](https://yuenalin.github.io/). I also interned at the HKUST-GZ DIGAI Lab, where I studied hyperbolic learning under the guidance of Prof. [Menglin Yang](https://yangmenglinsite.github.io/). I am deeply grateful for their guidance and support.<br>

        <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 0.85em; line-height: 1.4;">In this paper, we propose MAMC to address the problems caused by the feature heterogeneity and the information redundancy. Through introducing the multi-scale alignment module, MAMC sufficiently mines the inter-view commonality to tighten instances and inter-class difference to delimit the decision boundaries.</p>
