My name is Yiyuan Wang, and I currently reside in Chaoyang, Beijing. I am studying at the School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing University of Technology, and I am expected to obtain my Bachelor's degree in June 2025. At the moment, I am also a remote intern at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST-GZ). My research interests focus on **Multi-view learning**, **Hyperbolic learning**, and **Contrastive learning**.

If you would like to communicate or collaborate with me, please send an email to: [YiyuanWang001@outlook.com](mailto:YiyuanWang001@outlook.com)

        <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 0.85em; line-height: 1.4;">In this paper, we propose MAMC to address the problems caused by the feature heterogeneity and the information redundancy. Through introducing the multi-scale alignment module, MAMC sufficiently mines the inter-view commonality to tighten instances and inter-class difference to delimit the decision boundaries.</p>
