My name is Yiyuan Wang, and I currently reside in Chaoyang, Beijing. I am studying at the School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing University of Technology, and I am expected to obtain my Bachelor's degree in June 2025. At the moment, I am also a remote intern at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST-GZ). My research interests focus on **Multi-view learning**, **Hyperbolic learning**, and **Contrastive learning**.

If you would like to communicate or collaborate with me, please send an email to: [YiyuanWang001@outlook.com](mailto:YiyuanWang001@outlook.com)

        <h3>Enhance Multi-View Classification through Multi-Scale Alignment and Expanded Boundary</h3>
        <p><a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=t1J2CnDFwj">Paper</a></p>
        <p>Y. Lin, Y. Wang, G. Lyu, Y. Deng, H. Cai, H. Lin, H. Wang, Z. Yang.</p>
        <p>In this paper, we propose MAMC to address the problems caused by the feature heterogeneity and the information redundancy. Through introducing the multi-scale alignment module, MAMC sufficiently mines the inter-view commonality to tighten instances and inter-class difference to delimit the decision boundaries.</p>
